# Sentence Similarity Calculator
This repo contains various ways to calculate the similarity between source and target sentences. You can choose **the pre-trained models** you want to use such as _ELMo_, _BERT_ and _Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)_.

And you can also choose **the method** to be used to get the similarity:

    1. Cosine similarity
    2. Manhattan distance
    3. Euclidean distance
    4. Angular distance
    5. Inner product
    6. TS-SS score
    7. Pairwise-cosine similarity
    8. Pairwise-cosine similarity + IDF
    
You can experiment with (**The number of models**) x (**The number of methods**) combinations!
    
<br/>

## Installation

- This project is developed under **conda** enviroment
- After cloning this repository, you can simply install all the dependent libraries described in `requirements.txt` with `bash install.sh`

```
conda create -n sensim python=3.7
conda activate sensim
git clone https://github.com/Huffon/sentence-similarity.git
cd sentence-similarity
bash install.sh
```

<br/>

## Usage
- To **test** your own sentences, you should fill out [**corpus.txt**](corpus.txt) with sentences as below:

```
I ate an apple.
I went to the Apple.
I ate an orange.
...
```

- Then, **choose** the **model** and **method** to be used to calculate the similarity between source and target sentences

```
python sensim.py
    --model    MODEL_NAME  [use, bert, elmo]
    --method   METHOD_NAME [cosine, manhattan, euclidean, inner,
                            ts-ss, angular, pairwise, pairwise-idf]
    --verbose  LOG_OPTION (bool)
```

<br/>

## Examples
- In this section, you can see the example result of `sentence-similarity`
- As you know, there is a no **silver-bullet** which can calculate **_perfect similarity_** between sentences
- You should conduct various experiments with your dataset
    - _**Caution**_: `TS-SS score` might not fit with **sentence** similarity task, since this method originally devised to calculate the similarity between long documents
- **Result**:
